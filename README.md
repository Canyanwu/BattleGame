This repository contains code samples that demonstrate my skills and  experience in the following:

* Python
* Problem Solving Approach
* object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Abstract Data Types (ADT)
* Unit testing (Python unittest)

## Implementation of Army Battle game of two players.
The objective of this is to design and implement in Python classes that require inheritance
and use readily available Stack and Queue ADTs, use and modify UnitTest code and continue
practicing the implementation of correct, high quality and well documented code.

This game has two players.

Each has a budget of $30 to buy an army that can be composed of three different kinds of fighter units:

1. soldiers
2. archers
3. cavalry

After each player buys as many units as it wants with the $30 available, the army of each
player takes positions to get ready for battle as follows: all soldiers are positioned first,
then all archers, and finally all the cavalry. That way, soldiers will battle first, then
archers, and finally the cavalry and the winner of the battle is return.
